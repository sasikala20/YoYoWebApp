# YoYoWebApp

1. When a Yo-Yo test starts a timer, it is also started to keep track of the time. 
2. This timer will be visible and will update the level and shuttle times and other data. 
3. All test results (level, shuttle, etc.) are calculated based on the time. 
4. The timer is responsible for triggering audio clips (beeps), so runners will know when to run. 
5. The first time an Athlete is not able to run to the other side before a Yo-Yo is heard, he gets a warning. 
6. The second time he is out of the running test and application will automatically based on his test result.
